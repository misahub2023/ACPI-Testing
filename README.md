#  ACPI Testing: A Real Time Application To Detect Polyps

## Project Overview
The Automatic Colonoscopy Polyp Identification App is an innovative, real-time application designed to assist medical professionals in the detection of colonoscopy polyps using a fine-tuned, interpretable deep learning model based on the VGG-16 architecture. This app aims to address the issue of selection bias in existing colonoscopy datasets by providing a more robust and accurate tool for automatic colonoscopy polyp detection (ACPD). Through its user-friendly interface, healthcare providers can utilize the app to identify colonoscopy frames as polyp or no-polyp.

## ACPI Testing  App
The [**ACPI Testing metadata**](https://zenodo.org/records/7874340)  has all the metadata related to the work done on Automatic Colonoscopy Polyp Identification. It also contains the APK file for users to download and start utilizing the application.

## Getting Started
These instructions will guide you through setting up and running the app on your local machine.

### Prerequisites
- Flutter SDK: [Installation Guide](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)
